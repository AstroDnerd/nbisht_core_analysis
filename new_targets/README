This is the new target machinery.

Instead of just the densest zones, we 
1.) Find peaks.
2.) Throw out peaks less than 1100.  These are all turbulent fluctuations.
    We can justify this with the CDF of peak densities.
3.) For each peak, cut out particles between \rho_max^{3/4} and \rho_max
4.) For peaks that have overlapping lower contours, bump the contours up so they don't overlap.
5.) This is kind of a kludge.  
6.) Finally run new_tracks, which will read the target files.

get_new_targets*.py:
    First, take the mountain tops.
    Then, look for collisions.  Re-contour.
    Then make the mountain tops again with the new contours.
	there are several of these.

new_tracks_*.py  
	makes the new tracks.  These will be used for analysis.
